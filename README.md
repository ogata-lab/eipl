## What's EIPL?

EIPL (Embodied Intelligence with Deep Predictive Learning) is a library for robot motion generation using deep predictive learning developed at [Ogata Laboratory](https://ogata-lab.jp/), [Waseda University](https://www.waseda.jp/top/en).
Highlighted features include:

- [**Full documentation**](https://ogata-lab.github.io/eipl-docs) for the systematic understanding of deep predictive learning
- **Easy model training:** Includes sample datasets, source code, and pre-trained weights
- **Applicable to real robots:** Generalized motion can be acquired with small data sets

## Install
